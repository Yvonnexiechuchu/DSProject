#### Customer Profiling Using R

***Description***  
Profiles describe customers categorically so they can be grouped for marketing and advertising purposes.   

By understanding customers in different segments, companies can make better decisions on targeting and marketing strategy to increase profits.   

Our team used a customer purchase history dataset from a UK retailer (spread across Europe), segmenting customers based on their purchase behavior and profiled them
subsequently based on their demographics, preference of products and purchase behavior.
