### Intro
#### Predicting Customer Churn in R

***Description***  

MQ&M is a leading company in the telecom industry. Its marketing department wants to identify customers who are at risk of leaving their services. The dataset that we have provided collects attributes of MQ&M’s
customers, including their demographic information (e.g. gender, age, if they have partners and dependents), account information (e.g. how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method,
monthly and total charges), services that each customer signed up for (e.g. phone, Internet, tech support, online backup), and finally a column called Churn that describes whether a customer has left in the past
month or not.   

There are 7,043 rows in the dataset, with each row representing a record for a single customer. There are 21 columns, which include both continuous and categorical variables. We retrieved the data from
Kaggle.
